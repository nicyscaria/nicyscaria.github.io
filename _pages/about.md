🙎🏽‍♀️ I am a second year PhD student in [Computational and Data Sciences](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/)!

🕵🏽‍♀️ I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Generative AI, Knowledge Graphs, Reinforcement Learning and Computational Social Sciences. I am passionate about education and strongly believe that inclusive and quality education is a way to bring social equality. My research interests are in building personalized adaptive learning solutions using lightweight models that can deployed at scale for students in an Indian context.

🗓️ I am currently working towards generating educational questions of different cognitive levels as defined in Bloom's taxonomy and automatically evaluating these machine generated questions.

📁 Before joining for PhD, I worked as a Project Scientist at [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/). Prior to that, I did a two-year [Teach for India](https://www.teachforindia.org/) fellowship. I graduated from [College of Engineering, Trivandrum](https://www.cet.ac.in/) with an M.Tech in Control Systems. I completed by B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [SCMS School of Engineering and Technology, Ernakulam](https://scmsgroup.org/sset/). 

🏔️ I am also interested in teaching, learning how people think and learn, traveling, hiking, art, music, movies and food. 

📨 I am open to discussions and interested in exchanging research perspectives. If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:nicyscaria@iisc.ac.in)!
