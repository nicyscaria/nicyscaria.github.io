🙎🏽‍♀️ I am a second year PhD student in [Computational and Data Sciences](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/)!

🕵🏽‍♀️ I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Generative AI, Knowledge Graphs and Reinforcement Learning. My research interests are in building personalized adaptive learning solutions for students through artificial intelligence in an Indian context. 

🗓️ I am currently working towards generating educational questions of different cognitive levels as defined in Bloom's taxonomy and automatically evaluating these machine generated questions.

🏔️ I am also interested in teaching, learning how people think and learn, traveling, hiking, art, music, movies and food. 

Experience
======
👩🏻‍🔬 **Project Scientist I, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru,** 🗓️ May 2021 - July 2022

I worked with the [M.Tech.(Online) Programme](https://iken.iisc.ac.in/mtech-online/index.html) Team for supporting faculty in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Business Analytics, and Electronics and Communications Engineering streams. I also created learning materials like interactive simulations and videos using GeoGebra and Manim libraries respectively for Linear Algebra (E1 219o) and Random Processes (E2 212o) courses.

💻 **Head of Technology, Mokusei Intelligence, Bengaluru,** 🗓️ January 2022 - June 2022

I led 2 teams of developers creating a crowdfunding website/platform for education (investment-based) and a mobile application for the prediction of scores and attaining scholarships based on these predictions.

👩🏽‍🏫 **Fellow, Teach for India, Chennai,** 🗓️ June 2019 - April 2021

I taught English, Science, and Literacy to one hundred and one grade seven students and Social and Emotional skills to one hundred and seventy-four grade 7 and 8 students at Chennai High School, Thiruvenkatasamy Street, Pulianthope during 2020-2021. I also taught all subjects to thirty-seven grade four students at Anjuman Matriculation Higher Secondary School (Primary), T. Nagar, for the academic year (2019-2020)

👩🏽‍🎓 **Student Leadership Intern, Teach for India, Chennai,** 🗓️ May 2020 - June 2020

I created sequenced learning circle plans for Social, Emotional, and Ethical Learning and designed activities and performance tasks to build 21st Century Skills in students for fellows across the city and worked with different stakeholders within and outside the organisation to understand various approaches to student leadership in the region.

🔬 **Data and Research Intern, Young India Foundation, New Delhi,** 🗓️ December 2019 - March 2020

I published an [educational research paper](https://www.academia.edu/43109740/Significance_of_Inclusivity_and_Diversity_Framework_in_21st_century_India) with a team of 5 research interns in Academia to provide suggestions to Think Tanks such as Niti Aayog and the Centre for Civil Society and explored different 21st Century Skills Framework, their implementation, and assessment to hypothesize factors contributing to the skills gap in the youth.

🚓 **Project Intern, Tata Elxsi, Trivandrum,** 🗓️ May 2018 - June 2019

I engineered an adaptive PID controller designed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using MicroAutoBox II to operate the steering system autonomously in a Suzuki Ignis ([Robo-Taxi](https://tataelxsi.com/storage/solutions/February2021/J0jsi8pIMUsEC3CINghu.pdf)). I developed a time series model of the Electric Power Steering in Suzuki Ignis using System Identification by perturbing the system with different reference signals and designed an Adaptive Model Predictive Controller for motion planning
