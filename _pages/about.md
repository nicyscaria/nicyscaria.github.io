🙎🏽‍♀️ I am a second year PhD student in [Computational and Data Sciences](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/)!

🕵🏽‍♀️ I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, Generative AI, Knowledge Graphs and Reinforcement Learning. My research interests are in building personalized adaptive learning solutions for students through artificial intelligence in an Indian context. 

🗓️ I am currently working towards generating educational questions of different cognitive levels as defined in Bloom's taxonomy and automatically evaluating these machine generated questions.

📁 Before joining for PhD, I worked as a Project Scientist at [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/). Prior to that, I did a two-year [Teach for India](https://www.teachforindia.org/) fellowship. I graduated from [College of Engineering, Trivandrum](https://www.cet.ac.in/) as the topper in Control Systems (M.Tech). I completed by B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [SCMS School of Engineering and Technology, Ernakulam](https://scmsgroup.org/sset/). 

🏔️ I am also interested in teaching, learning how people think and learn, traveling, hiking, art, music, movies and food.
