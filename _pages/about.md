🙎🏽‍♀️ I am a third year PhD student in [Computational and Data Sciences](https://cds.iisc.ac.in/) at [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/)!

🕵🏽‍♀️ I am broadly interested in natural language processing, large language models, knowledge representation, and cognitive neuroscience. My research focuses on developing intelligent agents that combine domain reasoning with adaptive learning capabilities. Drawing from cognitive science principles, I build AI systems that understand subject-specific concepts and personalize their interactions through automated assessment and feedback, adapting to each student’s learning journey.

🗓️ I am currently working towards generating educational questions of different cognitive levels as defined in Bloom's taxonomy and automatically evaluating these machine generated questions.

📁 Before joining for PhD, I worked as a Project Scientist at [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/). Prior to that, I did a two-year [Teach for India](https://www.teachforindia.org/) fellowship. I graduated from [College of Engineering, Trivandrum](https://www.cet.ac.in/) with an M.Tech in Control Systems. I completed by B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [SCMS School of Engineering and Technology, Ernakulam](https://scmsgroup.org/sset/). 

🏔️ I am also interested in teaching, learning how people think and learn, traveling, hiking, art, music, movies and food. 

📨 I am open to discussions and interested in exchanging research perspectives. If you are interested in collaborating, feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:nicyscaria@iisc.ac.in)!
