### âœ… Assessment of Large Language Modelsâ€™ Ability to Generate Relevant and High-Quality Questions at Different Bloomâ€™s Skill Levels
We examined the ability of five state-of-the-art LLMs to generate relevant and high-quality questions of different cognitive levels, as defined by Bloom's taxonomy. We prompted each model with the same instructions and different contexts to generate 510 questions. Two human experts used a ten-item rubric to assess the linguistic and pedagogical relevance and quality of the questions. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate relevant and high-quality educational questions of different cognitive levels, making them useful for creating assessments.

### ðŸš™ Lateral Control of an Autonomous Vehicle
The electric power steering of the Suzuki Ignis ([Robo-Taxi](https://tataelxsi.com/storage/solutions/February2021/J0jsi8pIMUsEC3CINghu.pdf)) was automatically controlled with an adaptive PID controller designed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using MicroAutoBox II. An Adaptive Model Predictive Controller was used for motion planning.
